# My Portfolio-Page
## To view [Click Here!](https://josemm83.github.io/Portfolio-Page/)
This is my portfolio page using Materialize. 
Works with all screen sizes from desktop, tablets, or phones.

## How the magic works
With Materialize some features are used such as Parallax, Scrollspy, SideNav, Tab.

Parallax gives the user an experience with an image by giving it an effect.

Scrollspy allows the users to go to the section that is clicked such as Portfolio, Contact, About. 

SideNav works on smaller screens and creates links to sections.

Tab works inside the about section where the user can click on the given links and text will appear and disappear.
